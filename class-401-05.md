## Linked Lists

* A Linked List is a series of Nodes that are connected to each other, each Node references the next Node in the link.

* The types of Linked List:
1. Singly: refers to the number of references the node has.
2. Doubly: means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

### Traversal:
> When we have to traversing a linked list, we can't use a foreach or for loop, the best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while loop to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.


### Big O:
> The Big O of Time should be O(n) because, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.
> The Big(O) of Space should be O(1) because there is no additional space being used.


### To list or not to list?
- If we having to do something that requires a lot of traversal, iteration, or quick index-level access, a linked list could be our worst enemy. In those situations, an array might be a better solution, since you can find things quickly (a single chunk of allocated memory), and you can use an index to quickly retrieve a random element in the middle or end of the list without having to take the time to traverse through the whole entire thing.

- a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.

### Memory management
- The biggest difference between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines. 
If we had 7 letters that we needed to store in an array, we would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array. But, we’d need all of that memory in one contiguous block. That is to say, our computer would need to locate 7 bytes of memory that was free, one byte next to the another, all together, in one place.
- When we use a linked list, it doesn’t need 7 bytes of memory all in one place, one byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether! Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.
