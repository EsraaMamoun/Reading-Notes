## Context

* context is that what the value of this is for your code that is running.

- For example:
> If we console log of the value of this in the root scope by default (this) is the window object so if you try to console.log(this === window) you will see in the console results (true) because yes this here is equal window ,
- but this inside object by default it runs  with a context of the this value is the object that sits on 
- there is a tricky thing about this value can actually change depending on how you call the function (the function inside the object as a property) depending on how runs it and by and how they are running it the value of this can actually change  
* there are three JavaScript methods of changing context they are call, apply, and bind:
> for (.call() or .apply()) when you want to invoke the function immediately and modify the context.
> and .bind() when you want that function to later be called with a certain context, that can be useful in events. 

> call and apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function that, when later executed, will have the correct context set for calling the original function. This way you can maintain context in async callbacks and events.

when we use JQuery and put a function (on) some element when we use this value we will see the elements what we click on it. 

## Test-driven development (TDD)

- For the developers there is a lot of steps to do to make the their works in a right way, here comes the TTD benefits to change the regular workflow.

- usually there is some steps for the developers to do like: what the code should do, how to write it, write the code to do what should do, and test the to see if everything works right.

> so TDD is a software development process dependent on cycle of specific short tests, then improve the code to pass the tests.

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- We can know fast feedback.
- It save our time in debugger.
- We can  identify the errors and problems quickly..

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- If we have more than one test to do.

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- The test should return one specific value rather than any other things only the developer's think about it.

`A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and returns a function as its result.`
