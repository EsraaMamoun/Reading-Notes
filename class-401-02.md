## Context

* context is that what the value of this is for your code that is running.

- For example:
> If we console log of the value of this in the root scope by default (this) is the window object so if you try to console.log(this === window) you will see in the console results (true) because yes this here is equal window ,
- but this inside object by default it runs  with a context of the this value is the object that sits on 
- there is a tricky thing about this value can actually change depending on how you call the function (the function inside the object as a property) depending on how runs it and by and how they are running it the value of this can actually change  
* there are three JavaScript methods of changing context they are call, apply, and bind:
> for (.call() or .apply()) when you want to invoke the function immediately and modify the context.
> and .bind() when you want that function to later be called with a certain context, that can be useful in events. 

> call and apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function that, when later executed, will have the correct context set for calling the original function. This way you can maintain context in async callbacks and events.

when we use JQuery and put a function (on) some element when we use this value we will see the elements what we click on it.
