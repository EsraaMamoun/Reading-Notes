# SuperAgent
- SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

* GET requests
> The .query() method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string.

* POST / PUT requests
> A typical JSON POST request might look a little like the following, where we set the Content-Type header field appropriately, and "write" some data, in this case just a JSON string.

`Since JSON is undoubtedly the most common, it's the _default_!`

`By default sending strings will set the Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multiple calls will be concatenated with &, here resulting in name=tj&pet=tobi`

- SuperAgent formats are extensible, however by default "json" and "form" are supported. To send the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded simply invoke .type() with "form", where the default is "json". This request will POST the body "name=tj&pet=tobi".

- As a short-hand the .type() method is also available, accepting the canonicalized MIME type name complete with type/subtype, or simply the extension name such as "xml", "json", "png", etc.

* Serializing request body
> SuperAgent will automatically serialize JSON and forms.

### Retrying requests
- When given the .retry() method, SuperAgent will automatically retry requests, if they fail in a way that is transient or could be due to a flaky Internet connection.

- This method has two optional arguments: number of retries (default 3) and a callback. It calls callback(err, res) before each retry. The callback may return true/false to control whether the request sould be retried (but the maximum number of retries is always applied).

### Setting Accept
- In a similar fashion to the .type() method it is also possible to set the Accept header via the short hand method .accept(). Which references request.types as well allowing you to specify either the full canonicalized MIME type name as type/subtype, or the extension suffix form as "xml", "json", "png", etc.

* TLS options
> In Node.js SuperAgent supports methods to configure HTTPS requests:

- .ca(): Set the CA certificate(s) to trust
- .cert(): Set the client certificate chain(s)
- .key(): Set the client private key(s)
- .pfx(): Set the client PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain
