# SuperAgent
- SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

* GET requests
> The .query() method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string.

* POST / PUT requests
> A typical JSON POST request might look a little like the following, where we set the Content-Type header field appropriately, and "write" some data, in this case just a JSON string.

`Since JSON is undoubtedly the most common, it's the _default_!`

`By default sending strings will set the Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multiple calls will be concatenated with &, here resulting in name=tj&pet=tobi`

- SuperAgent formats are extensible, however by default "json" and "form" are supported. To send the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded simply invoke .type() with "form", where the default is "json". This request will POST the body "name=tj&pet=tobi".

- As a short-hand the .type() method is also available, accepting the canonicalized MIME type name complete with type/subtype, or simply the extension name such as "xml", "json", "png", etc.

* Serializing request body
> SuperAgent will automatically serialize JSON and forms.

### Retrying requests
- When given the .retry() method, SuperAgent will automatically retry requests, if they fail in a way that is transient or could be due to a flaky Internet connection.

- This method has two optional arguments: number of retries (default 3) and a callback. It calls callback(err, res) before each retry. The callback may return true/false to control whether the request sould be retried (but the maximum number of retries is always applied).

### Setting Accept
- In a similar fashion to the .type() method it is also possible to set the Accept header via the short hand method .accept(). Which references request.types as well allowing you to specify either the full canonicalized MIME type name as type/subtype, or the extension suffix form as "xml", "json", "png", etc.

* TLS options
> In Node.js SuperAgent supports methods to configure HTTPS requests:

- .ca(): Set the CA certificate(s) to trust
- .cert(): Set the client certificate chain(s)
- .key(): Set the client private key(s)
- .pfx(): Set the client PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain


### APIs Application programming interface
>> An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or systems can use it. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.[1] An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be "interrogated" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details "behind" that API without affecting its users.

>> Today, with the rise of REST and web services over HTTP, the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the Web APIs section).

>> Sometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.
