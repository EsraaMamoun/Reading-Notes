## Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

### Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
- Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine, and the NoSQL is horizontally in order to improve performance on database servers, database administrators have had to buy bigger servers as the database load increases (scaling up) instead of distributing the database across multiple “hosts” as the load increases (scaling out). RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) do not typically scale out easily, but the newer NoSQL databases are actually designed to expand easily to take advantage of new nodes.

### Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
Massive volumes of data are easily handled by NoSQL databases.

### Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
1. Heroku.
2. ScaleGrid.
3. Bitnami.

#### Models
- Models enhances compatibility between developers and customers
- It also makes them agree on certain terms and vocabulary
- also the model highlights the chosen terms so that they can be driven forward into software artifacts so the result software becomes easier to maintain and extend.

#### CRUD
- CRUD  refers to create, read, update, and delete. the 4 basic functions in storage data, each letter in the acronym refer to all functions executed in relational database applications and SQL statement.
- It can describe user-interface conventions that allow viewing, searching, and modifying information through computer-based forms and reports.

`SQL is Structured Query Language.` 

#### PostgreSQL
> PostgreSQL is object-relational database management system

#### MongoDB
> MongoDB: is NoSQL database it is a cross-platform document-oriented database program and it uses like a JSON documents with the schema.

#### Mongoose
> Mongoose: is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) it is a  library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code.
