## Message Queues

- A message queue is a component of messaging middleware that makes it easier to develop resilient connections between applications, & a Queue server runs independently, and is tasked with routing events and messaging between clients.

## Message:
- Is a package of information, categorized by queue and event queue
 
## Namespace: 
- Is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

**Default namespace**
- We call the default namespace / and it’s the one Socket.IO clients connect to by default, and the one the server listens to by default.

`Socket.IO allows you to “namespace” your sockets, which essentially means assigning different endpoints or paths, this is a useful feature to minimize the number of resources (TCP connections).`
