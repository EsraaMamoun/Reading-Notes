## Redux - Asynchronous Actions

**Redux Thunk middleware** 
- It allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

**What’s a thunk?**
- A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

**Composition**
- Any return value from the inner function will be available as the return value of dispatch itself. This is convenient for orchestrating an asynchronous control flow with thunk action creators dispatching each other and returning Promises to wait for each other’s completion.

**Asynchronous Redux Actions Using Redux Thunk**
- The most common use-case for Redux Thunk is for communicating asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data. Redux Thunk makes it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.

**React Suspense**
- Suspense is a new React feature that was announced recently. It aims to help with handling async operations respectively in regard to CPU power and data fetching. And it allows you to defer rendering part of your application tree until some condition is met (for example, data from an endpoint or a resource is loaded).
