## Stacks and Queues

*First of all I need to clearify these concepts:*

**Both of Stacks & Queues follow these concepts:**
> - FILO: Acronym for (First In Last Out) --> This means that the first item added will be the last item popped out.
> - LIFO: Acronym for (Last In First Out) --> This means that the last item added will be the first item popped out.
> - IsEmpty: returns true when stack or queue is empty otherwise returns false.
> - Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack or queue. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

**Stacks follow these concepts:**
> - Push: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
> - Pop: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. 
> - Top: This is the top of the stack.

**Queues follow these concepts:**
> - Enqueue: Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
> - Dequeue: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
> - Front: This is the front/first Node of the queue.
> - Rear: This is the rear/last Node of the queue.


### Stack: 
- It is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, `but does not reference its previous`.
> `Push O(1)`: Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation.
> `Pop O(1)`: Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top.
> `Peek O(1)`: When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.


### Queue:
- It is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
> `Enqueue O(1)`: When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action.

> `Dequeue O(1)`: When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action.

> `Peek O(1)`: When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.
