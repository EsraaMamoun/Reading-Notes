# Links
> Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

> Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Opening Links in a New Window:
`If we want a link to open in a new window, we can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank. `
`Ex: <a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank"> opens in new window </a>.`

## Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:
> Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. > You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element).
`<h1 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h1> then in the bpttom page --> <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>`

**We can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.**

# Layout
## Building Blocks
> CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
> Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and  sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors. 

## Containing Elements
> If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

*Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.*

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# Functions, Methods & Objects
- Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. 
- A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside (and are part of) an object. 
- objects are made up of properties and methods. 
## BUILT-IN OBJECTS
> The browser comes with a set of objects that act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 

* Declearing a function
- To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its ttask inside the curly braces, this is known as a function declaration.

## Variable Scope
- The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. 


# Pair Programming
` While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The  Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.`
