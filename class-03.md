# Lists
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
- unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.

- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number. --> <ol> then <li>
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order). --> <ul> then <li>

`The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.`
`<dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).`
`<dd> This is used to contain the definition.`

- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes
***CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.***

> Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: Border, Margin & Padding
>> 1. Border
>>>Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
>> 2. Margin
>>> Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
>> 3. Padding
>>> Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

`The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.`


# Decisions and Loops
### If/Else statement 
> The if..else statement checks a condition: if it resolves to true the first code block is executed, if the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead.

### switch statement
> A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value, each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches the value.

`Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.`
`Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.`
`Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.`

---

### Loops
> Loops check a condition. if it returns true, a code will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns rtue, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.
*There are three common types; Each repeats a set of statements.*
1. For: If we need to run code a specific number of times.--> we tell how many times the loop should run.

2. While: If we don't know how many times the code should run.

3. Do while: It is like while loop but the diffence things here the (do while) it will always run the statements inside the curly brces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
