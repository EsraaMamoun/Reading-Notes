## Images
- There are many reasons why we might want to add an image to a web page: we might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

`To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).`

> Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

> we must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

## Color
- Color can really bring our pages to life.

> Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

* Color type:
1. RGB Values.
2. Hex Codes.
2. Color Names.

`The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied (not child elements).`

***CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.***

## Text
- The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
> Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
- Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

Typeface Terminology
1. Serif.
2. Sans-Serif.
3. Monospace.

- We can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
