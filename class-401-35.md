## Graphs

**Graphs** 
- Is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

**Some common terminology:**

- `Vertex`: A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- `Edge`: An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- `Neighbor`: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- `Degree`: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

**Undirected Graphs**
- Is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

**Directed Graphs (Digraph)**
- Is a graph where every edge is directed.

**Complete Graphs:**
- Is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

**Connected:**
- Is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

**Disconnected:**
- Is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

**Acyclic Graph:**
- Is a directed graph without cycles.
 
**Cyclic Graphs:**
- Is a graph that has cycles.


**Adjacency Matrix:**
- Is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

**Adjacency List:**
- Is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

**Weighted Graphs:**
- Is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.

**Real World Uses of Graphs:**
 > - GPS and Mapping
 > - Driving Directions
 > - Social Networks
 > - Airline Traffic
 > - Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
