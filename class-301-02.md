## jQuery
- jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed. 

- jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript. 

- jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the each () method. 

* WHY USE JQUERY?
> jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 
> 1. SIMPLE SELECTORS As you saw in Chapter 5, which introduced the DOM, it is not always easy to select the elements that you want to. 

> 2. COMMON TASKS IN LESS CODE There are some tasks that front-end developers need to do regularly, such as loop through the elements that have been selected.
