## Hash Tables

> Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

### Hash function
- A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

> For a good hash function it should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself & should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

### Separate chaining
- Each bucket is independent, and has some sort of list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation.

### Internal Methods
- Add() to adding a new key/value pair to a hashtable:

- Find() to find takes in a key

- Contains() to accept a key, and return a bool on if that key exists inside the hashtable.

- GetHash() to accept a key as a string, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.
