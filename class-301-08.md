# Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.


### Relational databases
- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

### What does the word relational in relational database mean?
- It is a common misconception that the word relational implies relationship between the tables. A relation is a mathematical term that is roughly equivalent to a table itself. When used in conjunction with the word database, we mean to say that this particular system arranges data in a tabular fashion.

`By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.`

### SQL Commands Classification
- SQL is a language for interacting with databases. It consists of a number of commands with further options to allow you to carry out your operations with a database. While DBMSâ€™s differ in the command subset they provide.
