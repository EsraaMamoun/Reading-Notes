## The regex tutorial
> Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).
> Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping.

1. data validation (for example check if a time string i well-formed).

2. data scraping (especially web scraping, find all pages that contain a certain set of words eventually in a specific order).

3. data wrangling (transform data from “raw” to another format).

4. string parsing (for example catch all URL GET parameters, capture text inside a set of parenthesis).

5. string replacement (for example, even during a code session using a common IDE to translate a Java or C# class in the respective JSON object — replace “;” with “,” make it lowercase, avoid type declaration, etc.).

syntax highlightning, file renaming, packet sniffing and many other.

## Guide to Grid
> CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).
