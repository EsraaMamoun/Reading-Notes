## React Native

- Is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.

**Expo:**
Is a framework for universal react applications. It's a set of tools and services built around React Native to help develop,deply and quickly iterate on iOs, Android and web apps from the same JS codebase. To start a new project, first globally install expo with npm install --global expo-cli. Then you can create a new project by expo init my-project.

**ExpoKit:** 
Is deprecated and will no longer be supported after SDK 38. If you need to make customizations to your Expo project, we recommend using the bare workflow instead.
