## Trees

**A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.**

**Some definitions:**
- Node: A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure.
- Root: The root is the first/top Node in the tree.
- Left Child: The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node.
- Right Child: The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node.
- Edge: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
- Leaf: A leaf is a node that does not contain any children.
- Height: The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node.

### Traversals
- An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree.

- There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.

- One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. To do so, we would leverage the use of breadth first traversal. During the traversal, we find the first node that does not have 2 child nodes, and insert the new node as a child. We fill the child slots from left to right.

### Binary Search Trees
- A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

### Big O:
- The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n). Because of the lack of organizational structure in a Binary Tree, the worst case for most operations will involve traversing the entire tree. If we assume that a tree has n nodes, then in the worst case we will have to look at n items, hence the O(n) complexity.
