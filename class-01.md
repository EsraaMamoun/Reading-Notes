# HTML LEARNING

## Introduction:
### How the Web Works?
> When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure:
>> **You may know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.**

### *Looking at How Other sites are Built?*
`When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages. These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, at www.htmlandcssbook.com/ code/ and click on the link called "View Source."`
`Once you have opened this page, you can look for the View menu in your browser, and select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.)`
`You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page.`

### Some information about HTML5
> In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.

***DOCTYPEs***
> Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).

## Process & Design:
***Why People Visit YOUR Website***
> Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.

***What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve***
> What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.

***What Information Your Visitors Need***
> You may want to offer additional supporting information that you think they might find helpful. Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals.

***How Often People Will Visit Your Site***
> Here are some questions to help you decide how often to update your website content...
>> Goods / Services
> - How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
> - How often is your stock updated or your service changed?
>> Information
> - How often is the subject updated?
> - What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will just need the information once?

# Intoduction About JavaScript
` JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing & modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser. `

*ACCESS CONTENT*
> You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.

*MODIFY CONTENT*
> You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.

*PROGRAM RULES*
> You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. 

*REACT TO EVENTS*
> You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
> <html>
>> CONTENT LAYER
>>> .html files 
>>>> This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics. 

> {css}
>> PRESENTATION LAYER
>>> .css files
>>>> The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.). 

> javascript()
>> BEHAVIOR LAYER
>>> .js files
>>>> This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.
