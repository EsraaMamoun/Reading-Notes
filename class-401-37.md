## Redux - Combined Reducers

**Combined reducers:** 
 > Is pulling in more than one reducer from source and creating a keyed object from them. `Each reducer technically has it’s own actions and creators`.
 > The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.  
 > The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object.  

**Arguments**
reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.

**Returns**
(Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape.

**Core Concepts:**
- The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing “slices” of domain-specific data at each top-level key, because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.
