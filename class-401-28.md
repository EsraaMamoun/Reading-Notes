## Props and State:

- In React, both this.props and this.state represent the rendered values, i.e. whatâ€™s currently on the screen, also in a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component & the state can be initialized by props.

- Props are also used to allow child components to access methods defined in the parent component. This is a good way to centralize managing the state in the parent component, and avoid children to have the need to have their own state.
- Props can be data or functions, we can pass functions around like variables.
