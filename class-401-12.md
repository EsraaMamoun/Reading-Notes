## OAuth

**OAUTH2:**
- is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials.

**How does OAuth work?**
- OAuth doesn't share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

**Access Code**
1. An identification number and/or password used to gain access into a computer system. 
2. The number used as a prefix to a calling number in order to gain access to a particular telephone service.

**Client ID and Secret:**
- After registering the app, we should receive a client ID and optionally a client secret. The client ID is considered public information, and is used to build login URLs, or included in Javascript source code on a page. The client secret must be kept confidential. If a deployed app cannot keep the secret confidential.

**Access Token**
- Is a string that identifies a user, app, or Page and can be used by the app to make graph API calls. When someone connects with an app using Facebook Login and approves the request for permissions, the app obtains an access token that provides temporary, secure access to Facebook APIs.

**Getting an Access Token:**
- The server exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to the authorization server's token endpoint.

**The API: "Resource Server"**
- Is the API server used to access the user's information.

**The User: "Resource Owner"**
- Is the person who is giving access to some portion of their account.

**The Third-Party Application: "Client"**
- Is the application that is attempting to get access to the user's account. It needs to get permission from the user before it can do so.
