### How to Solve Programming Problems
- The most mistakes when some one try to solve a programming problem they try to start writig the code as soon as possible.

- Should the programmer make sure first he/she take enough time to understand the problem completly befor starting solve it.

* To get the solution you should do a simple steps:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
7. As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.



### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

> Anyone can make a lot of money by using their time correctly.
For example, imagine if you earn $ 1,000 an hour, then what would be your estimate of time?
You must be more careful about every second of your life.
And when you yourself estimate your own time that other people will feel it and thus will appreciate your time as well.
> Stop being busy all the time. You can set yourself a work time. Do whatever you can and the rest of the day will be available to do whatever you want.
This will leave you with many options for doing more things in life, whether by exercising a hobby or using your time by learning a new thing or even sitting with your family.

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
> The most important feature that job officials usually look for is skill-solving problems.
It is a skill that is gained with experience, trial and error, but it can also come through the way of thinking
There must be a system to solve the problem and a way for your business to solve the problem, and not rely on luck, for this is the biggest mistake.
> There must always be several solutions to one problem and these solutions can be obtained through good planning and a good understanding of the problem you are facing.
So when you have many solutions, when one solution does not work, you will have an option to try the other solution and if it does not work then you will try others.
