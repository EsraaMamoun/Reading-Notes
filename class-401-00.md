### How to Solve Programming Problems
> The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.
You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

* A simple set of steps

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
7. As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

### Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive
- See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.
- But what if you placed a high value on your time?
- How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?
- Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.
- What would your life look like?
- What people would you stop putting up with?
- What problems would you stop wasting time on?
- What things would you stop — and start — doing?
- Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

* Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy
> “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine
> Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.
> But for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.
> For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
- Problem solving is the meta-skill.

- We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

- Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

- Try a solution.
- If that doesn’t work, try another one.
- If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
- Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

* The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

- “Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
- Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
- Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report).
