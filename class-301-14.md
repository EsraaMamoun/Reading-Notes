## Database Normalization

`Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.`

### Reasons for Database Normalization

**There are three main reasons to normalize a database:**
1. To minimize duplicate data.
2. To minimize or avoid data modification issues.
3. To simplify queries. 

**There are three modification anomalies that can occur:**

1. Insert Anomaly
> Database Normalization -  Insert Anomaly
> There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row.

2. Update Anomaly
> Table Update Anomaly
> In this case we have the same information in several rows. 

3. Deletion Anomaly
> Table Row Deletion Anomaly
> Deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.


***Summarize the various forms:***

- First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
- Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
- Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
