## Component Composition

**Routing is the process of keeping the browser URL in sync with whatâ€™s being rendered on the page. React Router lets you handle routing declaratively & the react-router
is a package provides the core routing functionality for React Router.**

### Component Composition 
- React's composition model we use it for example to re-use component code is tabs which show different content when selected. This guide will start with a set of tabs that re-use no code whatsoever and build specialized components, container components, and a combination of both to achieve re-use through composition.

- All React components have a special children prop so that consumers can pass components directly by nesting them inside the jsx. This prop can be used by a tab content component to accept the actual content without needing to know anything else about it.
