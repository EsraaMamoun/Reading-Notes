* Basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent Ex: a web browser to provide a user and password when making a request.
 
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is by far the best defense against the majority of password-related attacks.

* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

> JSON Web Tokens are useful where: 
* Authorization: once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. also, Information Exchange
`JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.)`
1. Header: typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used.
2. payload, which contains the claims.

`claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.`

3. Signature: To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
