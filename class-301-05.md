The last one allows you to determine a file's MIME-type. And it's not a part of Node.js, so we need to install third-party dependencies before using it. We need to create the package.json file for that purpose. It will contain project related information, such as name, version, description, and so on. For our project we will use MIME-types recognition, because it's not enough to just send the contents of a file when you use HTTP. You also need to set the Content-Type header with proper MIME-type. That's why we need this plug-in.**
