## React Testing and Deployment

#### Snapshot Testing:
Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly, a typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

#### Render Testing:
`react-test-renderer` --> this package provides a React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.

#### Shallow Renderer:
When writing unit tests for React, shallow rendering can be helpful. Shallow rendering lets you render a component “one level deep” and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.

#### Mounting:
Is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (Ex: DOM or Native Components). In a browser that would mean outputting a React Element into an actual DOM element (e.g. an HTML div or li element) in the DOM tree.
