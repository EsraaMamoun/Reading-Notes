## TCP Servers

**Event Queues:**
Is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.

**The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model):**
Is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.
This seven layer OSI model has continued to accurately describe the different processes in computer networking, and is used as a point of reference while working in networked systems. 

1. The 1st Layer Physical is a bit Protocol Data Unit and (transmission and reception of raw data streams over a physical medium) function, Ex: USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet physical layer, SMB, Telephone network modem.

2. The 2nd Layer Data Link is a Frame Protocol Data Unit and (Reliable transmission of frames between to physical layer nodes) function, Ex: Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN.

3. The 3ed Layer Network is a Packet Protocol Data Unit and (Managing the network through addressing, routing, and traffic control) function, Ex: IP and ICMP.

4. The 4th Layer Transport is a Segment / Datagram Protocol Data Unit and (Reliable transmission of data between points on a network) function, Ex: TCP and UDP.

5. The 5th Layer Session is a Data Protocol Data Unit and (Manages a session though passing data back and fourth) function, Ex: NetBios and Remote Procedure Protocol (RPC).

6. The 6th Layer Presentation is a Data Protocol Data Unit and (Data translating, including encryption, character encoding, and compression) function, Ex: Strings encoded with null terminated strings vs Strings defined by an Integer Length.

7. The 7th Layer Application is a Data Protocol Data Unit and (Height Level APIs) function, Ex: HTTP, IMAP, POP, SSH.

**Internet Protocol Suite:**
Is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**
Is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.

### TCP Three-Way Handshake Process 
> Syn: Used to initiate and establish a connection. It also helps you to synchronize sequence numbers between devices.
> ACK: Helps to confirm to the other side that it has received the SYN.
> SYN-ACK: SYN message from local device and ACK of the earlier packet.
> FIN: Used to terminate a connection.

>> The client sends a SYN packet with an random initial sequence number. The server sends a SYN-ACK packet with the acknowledgment number set to one more than the initial sequence number. The client responds with an ACK and an acknowledgment number incremented by one, that is what is known as a Connection Establishment. then it comes the Connection Termination: One end sends a FIN Segment and the other sends an ACK segment followed by a FIN segment. The termination initiation will then respond with an ACK segment.
