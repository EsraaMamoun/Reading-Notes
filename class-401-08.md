### Express Routing

**Routing**
> Routing is like how an application’s endpoints respond to client requests.

`application’s endpoints (URIs)` 

- The routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called handler functions) called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method.

* Express supports methods that correspond to all HTTP request methods: get, post, ... ==> CRUD methods.

**Route paths**
- Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made.

- `To create a server we should use Express to start the application server.`

* Express Router: 
> It is a mini express application without the junk stuff wich we don't need it of an express application, just the routing stuff.

* Route middleware: 
> It is a way to do something before a request is processed, like (ex:  logging data for analytics).
