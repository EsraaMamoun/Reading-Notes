## Forms
> The term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.
> Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.

### How Forms Work
> A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

> A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element. Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

## Lists 
> List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.


## Tables
> Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 


## Events
> Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. 

* INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS 
- Events occur when users click or tap on a link, hover or swipe over an element, t ype on the keyboard, resize the window, or when the page they requested has loaded. 

* EVENTS TRIGGER CODE 
> When an event occurs or fires, it can be used to trigger a particular function. Different code can be triggered when users interact with different parts of the page. 

* CODE RESPONDS TO USERS 
> The events can trigger the -kinds of changes the DOM is capable of. This is how a web page reacts to users. 

* HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE 
> When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling. 
>> 1. Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to. 

>> 2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. 

>> 3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs. 

`The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.`
