## Access Control (ACL)

* In some systems there is what is called Role-Based Access Control, Role, sort of is what you do your function perhaps that may learn what kind of files you can access if your human resources or payroll, or you are in the different department, the set files you can access would depend on what your role in the organization is. So there is role-based access control or RBAC that is implemented, it's a little different. 

`User --> Role --> Rights`

> In role-back Access Control, rights are for being able to access different resources, so those are access rights. Those are associated with the role, they're not not associated with the user. So the way to think about the way you going to define your policy access control policy is you're going to say, what roles do I have in my system?
> and for each role what kind of resources do they need to have access to? So I would say people in this role can read these files or write these files and things like that.
> RBAC, the way to think about this is that we don't have direct access rights for users.users must be activated into one or more roles.

- Role assignment: 
> A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- Role authorization: 
> A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With the fitst rule above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
- Permission authorization: 
> A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

**Access control lists (ACL):**
> Is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

**Attribute-based access control (ABAC):**
> sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a userâ€™s access request should be granted.
