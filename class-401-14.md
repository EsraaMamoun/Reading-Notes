## Access Control (ACL)

* In some systems there is what is called Role-Based Access Control, Role, sort of is what you do your function perhaps that may learn what kind of files you can access if your human resources or payroll, or you are in the different department, the set files you can access would depend on what your role in the organization is. So there is role-based access control or RBAC that is implemented, it's a little different. 

`User --> Role --> Rights`

> In role-back Access Control, rights are for being able to access different resources, so those are access rights. Those are associated with the role, they're not not associated with the user. So the way to think about the way you going to define your policy access control policy is you're going to say, what roles do I have in my system?
> and for each role what kind of resources do they need to have access to? So I would say people in this role can read these files or write these files and things like that.

> RBAC:
>> - A way to restrict network access based on user roles. Allowing employees to obtain access rights only to the information they need to perform their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that is not related to them.

- Role assignment: 
> A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- Role authorization: 
> It serves as an advertisement that the developer integrates into his code, and specifies the roles that the current user must be a member of to gain access to the requested resource..
- Permission authorization: 
> A person can only exercise permission if the authorization is delegated to them such as accessing some resources, modifying deletion or reading some things.

### Client Layer
> Refers to local interfaces used to author, model, analyze, present, report, and distribute diverse content, and third-party clients, such as Microsoft Office.

### API Layer
> A REST or Web services API layer offers a decoupled interface to data and/or functionality of one or more applications. It provides a common, language-agnostic way of interacting with an application.
