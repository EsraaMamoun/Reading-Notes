## Bearer Authorization

### Bearer authentication (token authentication):
- Is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens, it is encoded JSON objects that “bear” or “contain” enough information for the server to assert that any client request that presents a valid token must have originated from a client that has previously authenticated themselves using either Basic or OAuth. 

#### Basic Authentication:
- When the username and password are transmitted to a server.

#### OAuth:
- When there is a cumbersome handshaking/authorization process.

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT):
- Is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties (servers, clients, etc) as a JSON object.

#### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
**Authorization:**
> Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.

**Information Exchange:**
> JWTs can be signed, using public/private key pairs you can be sure the senders as what they say so JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, also, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with. 

#### What is the JSON Web Token structure?
- In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

`Header.Payload.Signature --> xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

#### Usage
- jwt.sign(payload, secretOrPrivateKey, [options, callback])
> (Asynchronous) If a callback is supplied, the callback is called with the err or the JWT.
> (Synchronous) Returns the JsonWebToken as string
> payload could be an object literal, buffer or string representing valid JSON.
