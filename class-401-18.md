## Socket.io

### The WebSocket API 
- Is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

### WebSocket
- Is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

### Socket.io
- It is a library which enables real-time and full duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers.
Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

`Socket.IO allows you to create several Namespaces, which will act as separate communication channels but will share the same underlying connection, & Room support: Within each Namespace, you can define arbitrary channels, called Rooms, that sockets can join and leave.`
