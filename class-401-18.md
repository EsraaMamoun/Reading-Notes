## Socket.io

### The WebSocket API 
- Is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

### WebSocket
- Is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

### Socket.io
- It is a library which enables real-time and full duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers.
Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

| WebSocket | Socket.io |
| --------- | --------- |
| It is the protocol which is established over the TCP connection. | It is the library to work with WebSocket. |
| It provides full duplex communication on TCP connections. | Provides the event-based communication between browser and server. |
| Proxy and load balancer is not supported in WebSocket. | A connection can be established in the presence of proxies and load balancers. |
| It doesn’t support broadcasting. | It supports broadcasting. |
| It doesn’t have a fallback option. | It supports fallback options. |

`Socket.IO allows you to create several Namespaces, which will act as separate communication channels but will share the same underlying connection, & Room support: Within each Namespace, you can define arbitrary channels, called Rooms, that sockets can join and leave.`


### Why do we need WebSocket?
1. It provides the full duplex communication which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
2. It also lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events.
3. WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
4. It makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.

### Why do we need Socket.IO:
It can handle all the degradation of your technical alternatives to get full duplex communication in real time, also, handles the various support level and the inconsistencies from the browser.
