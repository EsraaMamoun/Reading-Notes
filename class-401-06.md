## HTTP

- The HTTP is acronym for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. each HTTP message is either a request or a response. A server listens on a connection for a request,  parses each message received, interprets the message semantics in relation to the identified request target, and responds to that request with one or more response messages. A client constructs request messages to communicate specific intentions, examines received responses to see if the intentions were carried out, and determines how to interpret the results.

<!-- * Representation REST 
> Considering that a resource could be anything and that the uniform interface provided by HTTP is similar to a window through which one can observe and act upon such a thing only through the communication of messages to some independent actor on the other side, an abstraction is needed to represent (take the place of) the current or desired state of that thing in our communications. That abstraction is called a representation REST. -->

> Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures. provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.

* Swagger
> Is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.
