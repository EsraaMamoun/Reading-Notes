## Express Routing

* Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests, for more decliration:
> Routing is where an Express application responds to a client request from a URL or path and a specific HTTP request method, like GET or POST.

- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

> We can use Middleware functions for:
- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

* Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own.

* Server testing verifies that the services you need to develop your apps are working as intended.

* Test Pyramid
> The testing pyramid is a concept that helps you to balance your tests better. also, it delivers a graphical representation of a best-case test scenario.
