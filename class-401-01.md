## NPM

* NPM makes it easy for javascript developers to share the code they've created to solve particular problems and for other developers to reuse that code in their own applications and once you're depending on this code from other developers NPM makes it really easy to check to see if they've made any updates to it and to download those updates when they're made these bits of reusable code are called packages or sometimes modules.

* A package is just a directory with one or more files in it that also has a file called package JSON with some metadata about this package a typical application such as a website will depend on dozens or hundreds of packages these packages are often small the general idea is you create a small building block which solves one problem and solves it well, this makes it possible for you to compose larger custom solutions out of these small shared building blocks.

* How NPM works:
- When a developer decides to share their code they use the NPM client which is installed on their computer to publish that code up to the registry and once there's an entry for this package in the registry then other developers can use their NPM clients to install the package from the registry the entry in the registry for this package is also reflected on the website where there's a page dedicated to the new package. 

* In short:
- NPM it's a way to reuse code from other developers and also a way to share your code with them and it makes it easy to manage the different versions of code.
