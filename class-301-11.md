# The EJS

* What is EJS?
- EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

`EJS let's us spin up quick applications when we don't need anything too complex. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.`

# Using the API

* Authorizing requests and identifying your application
- Every request your application sends to the Books API needs to identify your application to Google. There are two ways to identify your application: using an OAuth 2.0 token (which also authorizes the request) and/or using the application's API key. Here's how to determine which of those options to use:

* If the request requires authorization (such as a request for an individual's private data), then the application must provide an OAuth 2.0 token with the request. The application may also provide the API key, but it doesn't have to.
* If the request doesn't require authorization (such as a request for public data), then the application must provide either the API key or an OAuth 2.0 token, or bothâ€”whatever option is most convenient for you.
* About authorization protocols
- Your application must use OAuth 2.0 to authorize requests. No other authorization protocols are supported. If your application uses Google Sign-In, some aspects of authorization are handled for you.

* When you create your application, you register it using the Google API Console. Google then provides information you'll need later, such as a client ID and a client secret.
Activate the Books API in the Google API Console. (If the API isn't listed in the API Console, then skip this step).

* When your application needs access to user data, it asks Google for a particular scope of access.
Google displays a consent screen to the user, asking them to authorize your application to request some of their data.
- If the user approves, then Google gives your application a short-lived access token.
- Your application requests user data, attaching the access token to the request.
- If Google determines that your request and the token are valid, it returns the requested data.
- Some flows include additional steps, such as using refresh tokens to acquire new access tokens. For detailed information about flows for various types of applications, see Google's OAuth 2.0 documentation.
