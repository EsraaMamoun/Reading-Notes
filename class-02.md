## Text
` When we creating a web page, we can add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.`

- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you *have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms.*
*HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).*

# Introducing CSS
> CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

- Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border. 

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

***A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.***
*Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.*

* Before you can use a viriabl, you need to announce that you want to use iy.This involves creating the viriable and giving it a name. Programming say that you decler the variable.

* An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

## Decisions and Loops

`There are often  several places in a script where decisions are made that determine which lines of code should be run next. Flow Charts can help us plan these occasions in write programming.`

> There are two components to a decision:
>> 1. An expression is evaluated, which retrns a value.
>> 2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation, like if statement.

> A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
>> Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
